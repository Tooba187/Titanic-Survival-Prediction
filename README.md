## Project Overview

The Titanic Survival Prediction project uses machine learning to predict whether a passenger would survive the Titanic disaster. It includes:
- **Data Preprocessing**: Handling missing values, encoding categorical variables, and feature engineering.
- **Model Training**: A Random Forest classifier is trained to predict survival.
- **GUI**: A user-friendly interface for making predictions.

---

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleans and prepares the Titanic dataset for modeling.
- **Machine Learning**: Uses a Random Forest model for prediction.
- **GUI**: Provides an interactive interface for users to input data and get predictions.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/titanic-survival-prediction.git
   cd titanic-survival-prediction
Usage
Train the Model:
Run the train_model.py script to preprocess the data, train the model, and save it:

bash
Copy
python train_model.py
Run the GUI:
Use the titanic_gui.py script to launch the GUI for making predictions:

bash
Copy
python titanic_gui.py
Input Data:
Enter the passenger details in the GUI fields and click "Predict Survival" to see the result.
